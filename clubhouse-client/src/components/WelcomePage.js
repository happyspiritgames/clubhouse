        <h2>You want to become a game designer, right?</h2>

        <p>You love playing games. Lately, you have been toying with the idea of designing a game of your own. After all, everyone plays games, but how many people come up with new games? That privilege used to be reserved for a select group of intellectuals who were hired and jealously guarded by giant corporate game companies.</p>

        <p>Hello, Milton Bradley. Oh, hi there, Electronic Arts.</p>

        <p>Now a growing number of people are becoming game designers, either as hobbyists or with the intent of launching a new career as an indie game developer, with a vision of publishing games for fun and profit. You are a dreamer, and you can see big things in your future. What if your game idea really takes off?</p>

        <p>The trouble is, where do you start? The choices are overwhelming. Watching free YouTube advice has you going in circles. Books on game design are dense with theory and jargon that are difficult to follow. You could really go for it and invest years in an advanced degree in game design. That seems like a leap too far, something you can postpone until needed, if ever.</p>

        <p>Do you lack artistic talent or want to create a video game but lack programming skills? What if nobody likes your game idea? The last thing you want to do is embarrass yourself.</p>

        <p>It’s easy to get lost in self-doubt and find reasons to procrastinate.</p>

        <p>Hey, that might be a fun game: Procrastination. In that game, you pick a lifetime goal for yourself, then find ways to avoid reaching it. The winner watches YouTube and Netflix all day long, secure in the knowledge that at least he won't be ridiculed.</p>

        <p>Maybe that game idea is a little too close to the truth. But in all seriousness, becoming a legendary game designer might seem like a wild fantasy. A bridge too far.</p>

        <p>Even the Parker brothers got a modest start. They just invented game after game, pitching ideas and continuously honing their craft. Eventually, over time, they built a great game company with many hits that are still popular today. Monopoly, Sorry!, and Risk, to name a few.</p>

        <p>You can be a game designer, too, but only by taking a step, designing your first game, and then another, and persisting until you get good at it. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

        <h2>This is the answer.</h2>

        <p>Now there’s an easy way to get started. The <i>Design a Game </i>course by Happy Spirit Games is just what you need, with a combination of videos and exercises that will lead you to your first game design. You will awaken your creative genius and think up a few games before the course is over.</p>

        <p>Here’s what you get.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Informative videos that give you the right perspective on inventing great games.</li>
          <li>Hands-on exercises designed to pump up your creativity and show you how to build prototypes of your games.</li>
          <li>Key concepts in game psychology, explained simply.</li>
          <li>Put what you are taught to use immediately.</li>
          <li>Timeless techniques for coming up with ideas you can apply to any subject. Spice up your life with all kinds of creative ideas.</li>
          <li>Support from real people. We want you to succeed, so we respond to email and will do what we can to help.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you are done, you will have a solid foundation for designing games. Also you will have your first game design to add to your portfolio.</p>

        <p>By enrolling now, you are locking in one year of access to the course materials. Re-watch the videos as often as you like during that time, and take advantage of bonus updates as they come out.</p>

        <h2>It's free!</h2>

        <p>This course gives you a clear and structured path to get started. You will learn everything you need to design your first game, without getting overwhelmed or lost in jargon.</p>

        <p>And you don't have to pay to take the course. There is no risk to you.</p>

        <p>Some courses for beginners say they are valued at $200 but only charge $9.99. That should make you wonder what is wrong. Is the material outdated? Did anyone ever pay the full price? How can the value of the course erode so quickly?</p>

        <p>Happy Spirit Games prices its courses so that you get at least twice the value you pay for. That means if we offer a course for $50, you are getting at least $100 of value. That's how we create a deal for you without resorting to marketing games.</p>

        <p>We don't mind getting paid for only half of the value because we want you to be a customer for life. <em>Design a Game</em> is for beginners, and that means we will have many more opportunities to help you grow once you get started.</p>

        <p>So now you are dying to know, what is the price for <em>Design a Game</em>? This is the first launch of this course. If you act now, you will lock in the introductory price of $27. That gets you access to the course materials for a full year from the date of enrollment.</p>

        <p>The price will only increase in the future as we make improvements and the course becomes even more valuable. By enrolling today, you can take advantage of those improvements without additional cost to you.</p>
